# Intelectual property

Intangible property - design, patent - technischer Ausbau, chemical formulas (recipe), copyright - protection of literary and artistic works, technology patent (bluetooth), database protection - contents of databases...

# Justification of intellectual property

Intelectual property should stimulate further innovation by rewarding the inventor

Incentive -> Innovation -> Reward -> Incentive...

If you don't monopolize the creations to their owners, people (companies) won't have any motivation to innovate - they can just use what is already invented & if they even invented something, it would not necessarily benefit them, because anyone could use it as well

# IP Rights

**Intellectual Property:** trademarks, patents, copyright, trade secrets, industrial design, geographical indications

## EU Copyright Law
Applies only when the following conditions are met:
1. **Relevant subject matter:**  literary, artistic and scientific works
2. **Originality:** it must be the "author's own intellectual creation"

Idea/expression dichotomy: *Copyright does not protect ideas as such but only their expression* = An idea for a book is not protected by copyright, but the written book itself - an expression of the idea, can be protected by copyright
The *stamp of the author* must be recognizable
### Owner of copyright
Copyright arises with the act of creation = there is no need to register a work
Associative workers that help you create a work may not be the owners of copyright, if they did not contribute their creativity in the making

Usually the creator of the work is the owner of copyright, but there may be some exceptions, for example if an employee codes an algorithm, the employer could be the owner of the copyright.

Copyright is valid while the Author is alive and 70 years after his death. Then the work enters the public domain.
Joint authorship: Copyright expires 70 years after death of the last surviving joint author.

If a composition is in the public domain, that does **not** necessarily mean, that every performation of the composition is copyright free!

### Copyright protection

1. **Economic rights** - right of reproduction, right of distribution, rental and lending right, right of communication to the public
2. **Moral rights** - Right of attribution / paternity - right to be identified as the author of the work, right of integrity - right to object to the derogatory treatment of the work
3. **Relaten/Neighboring rights** - Rights of press publishers, rights of performers, phonogram producers, rights of broadcasters, film producers

### Database protection

Database of independent works, data... arranged in a certain systematic way accessible via specific means, may be protected in two ways:
- **Sui generis** right: protecting the content of the database, there was a substantial investment needed to contain the contents of the database - laborwise, timewise, moneywise - the owner should be able to prove this investment (the maker must be EU citizen)
- **Copyright:** protects only the structure of a database

### Copyright infrigement

- Use of **substantial part** of the protected work

Unless:
- *De minimis* use: if only a small essential part of a work was used, but that is very uncertain, how small part of the work would be considered essential
- Exceptions permitted by law
- Copyright holder granted permission - licenses...

## Copyright exceptions

1. Mandatory exception in the Infsoc directive: temporary acts of reproduction + different mandatory exceptions in CDSM - use of works of visual art in public domain, text and data mining, use for online teaching...
2. Exhaustive but optional list of exceptions: reproductions for private use, reproduction and communication for teaching and scientific research, quotations for purposes such as criticism, use of the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche

### Acts and Data Mining exception

Acts of reproduction and extraction of copyright-protected or sui generis database right-protected subjet matter

- by research organisations and cultural heritage institutions
- for the purposes of scientific research
- Lawful access to works or other subject matter

- Copies may be stored **securely** for verification of research results

- Rightholders may reserve the use of the subject mater in an appropriate manner - e.g. machine-readable means
**We may not always know who owns a copyright or if a work has a copyright owner**

There may be a requirement coming to communicate to the public, on what copyrighted input data the AI model was trained

Copyright is human-centric. The creation of an AI is not protected by the copyright.
However! The output of an AI may be protected by other laws.
Human AI input prompt is not creative enough to be protected by copyright.
